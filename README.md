# Cryptography

A simple tool to encrypt and decrypt text messages.

## Description

It uses a randomly generated integer (the secret key) to encode the message by shifting the
letters. The encoded message should include both the shifted text and the secret key. On the Decode page, the user inputs an encoded message (encoded by our program). When the decode button is
pressed, the decoded message would be displayed.
